It doesn't has all the features that exist in the original remote, but only a subset.
You can control:
1. Whether to turn the A/C ON or OFF (A bit tricky).
2. A/C mode: cool, heat, dry, fan or auto.
3. Fan speed: low, medium, high or auto.
4. Swing: on/off
5. Sleep mode: on/off (raise temperature by one degree every 3 hours, turn off A/C after 8 hours)

Other features like timers or "I feel" are not supported.
